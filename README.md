#### This is a one page game built for a project.
* v1.0 Branch is a much harder version I initially created for fun.
* v2.0 Branch is a bit easier but does not include the same functionality as v3.0.
* v3.0 Meets the Udacity rubric, which includes a timer and zero chance of losing. **Error Prone. Not Listed As Branch**
* v3.1 Branch fixes problems with the timer and user interface experienced in v3.0.
* Master is the most updated version of v3.1 with additional comments and spelling error fixes.

I'm very happy with the results of this project since it was my first real working game in js.
